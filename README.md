- `start()`: Starts the countdown and updates the timer display every second.
- `stop()`: Pauses the countdown.
- `updateInterfaceTime()`: Updates the UI to reflect the remaining time.
- `updateInterfaceControls()`: Changes button appearance based on timer state.
- `getHTML()`: Generates the HTML structure for the timer component.
